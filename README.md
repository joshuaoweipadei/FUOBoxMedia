# FUOBoxMedia
An online community where students can relate easily on campus.
We intend to make the students of Federal University Otouke happy and appreciate the University by giving them an online platform where they can communicate and share ideas with friends, coursemates and other people on campus. This project is going to be the first of it kind in the University.

__We also hope to grow and improve on this project in future.__
